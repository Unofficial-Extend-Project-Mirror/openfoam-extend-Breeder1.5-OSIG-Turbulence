The grid is designed to have a y+ value of approximately 1 and
a stretching ratio of about 1.2 normal to the plate for a
Reynolds number based on plate length of 4e+6.

The boundary layer transitions from laminar to turbulent in the
vicinity of Rex = 1e+6.

The boundary layer at the end of the plate is compared with
its expected behavior in a series of gnuplot scripts included in
the gnuplot/ subdirectory; e.g.

gnuplot> load 'gnuplot/up.q'

The files are as follows:

up.q      velocity profile as u+ vs. y+ (log-linear)
qp.q      square root of turbulence kinetic energy as q+ vs. y+ (log-linear)
omega.q   square root of frequency as omega+ vs. y+ (log-log)
cf.q      skin friction coefficient along the plate vs. Rex (log-log)
resid.q   residual histories
