The original experimental results were kindly provided by Dellenback, for use in this OpenFOAM case-study.

Unfortunately, the data was only available on paper, which is what can be found in the scanned dellenbackData.pdf file.

An attempt to automatically extract (OCR) the data in the pdf file to a text file can be found in the dellenbackData.OCR file. This file can be used as a basis for generating the final files for comparisons.

The data that has been extracted and checked thoroughly are available as groups of four files for each operating condition:

Re?????Sw***AxialMean
Re?????Sw***AxialRMS
Re?????Sw***TangentialMean
Re?????Sw***TangentialRMS
where '?????' and '***' refer to the Reynolds number and swirl number for each case.
