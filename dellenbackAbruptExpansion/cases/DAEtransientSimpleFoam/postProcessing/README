Do automatic post-processing by doing the following:
(this example uses time step 16.8. To use another time step
modify the -time for sample, and modify in compareAll.gplt)

sample -case .. -time 16.8
gnuplot compareAll.gplt
mozilla file://$PWD/compareAll.html

To plot the status of the current run, do the following:
(This example assumes that you have a log file in your case directory)
foamLog ../log
gnuplot plotStatus.gplt
mozilla file://$PWD/plotStatus.html
